1. Installation
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-InstallationandConfiguration

Requirements:
Java 1.7+ 
Hadoop 2.x 

Installing Hive using a binary release:
$ tar -xzvf hive-x.y.z.bin.tar.gz

Set the environment variable HIVE_HOME in bash profile:
export HIVE_HOME=<hive-install-directory>
export PATH=$PATH:$HIVE_HOME/bin


2. Running Hive
Set the environment variable HADOOP_HOME in bash profile:
export HADOOP_HOME=<hadoop-install-dir>
export PATH=$HADOOP_HOME/bin:$PATH

In addition, you must use below HDFS commands to create /tmp and 
/user/hive/warehouse (aka hive.metastore.warehouse.dir) and set them 
chmod g+w before you can create a table in Hive.
Within your working directory:
$ hadoop fs -mkdir ./tmp
$ hadoop fs -chmod g+w /tmp
$ hadoop fs -mkdir ./user/hive/warehouse

2. Running HiveServer2 and Beeline

Starting from Hive 2.1, we need to run the schematool command below 
as an initialization step before running hive. 
$ schematool -initSchema -dbType derby
$ hive

After installing hive, if the first thing you did was run hive, even though it
fails, hive creates a metastore_db directory in the directory from which you ran 
hive. If you already ran hive and then tried to initiate Schema and it's failing,
remove metastore_db and derby.log:
$ rm -rf metastore_db derby.log
Then run schematool and hive again.
